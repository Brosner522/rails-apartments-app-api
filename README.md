# Apartments App

## Setup

To download the dependencies for backend, run:

```sh
bundle install
```

There is some starter code in the `db/seeds.rb` file so that once you've
generated the models, you'll be able to create data to test your application.

You can run your Rails API on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by running:

```sh
rails s
```
Check your progress by: Running the Rails server and using Postman make requests
